# Sirius Sense
### Pure Performance. No Compromise.
ESP Library
## Booting Sense
```lua
local Sense = loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shlexware/Sirius/request/library/sense/source.lua'))()
```

### Changing Configuration
You'll need to do this for every value you'd like to change using this method.
If you'd like to know what you can change, read the [`Sense Default Configuration`](https://github.com/shlexware/Sirius/blob/request/library/sense/Documentation.md#sense-default-configuration) part of the documentation.
```lua
Sense.teamSettings.Enemy.enabled = true
```

## Loading Sense
Run this under the code changing the configuration to your liking.
```lua
Sense.Load()
```

## Sense Default Configuration
This is the default configuration for Sense, and most things will be disabled by default.
This shows you everything you can change.

## Sense Functions
These are our built-in functions for Sense which you can edit to give the library information about the player in games with for example custom replication systems.
```lua
function Sense.getTeam(player)
    return player and player.Team;
end

function Sense.getCharacter(player)
    return player and player.Character;
end

function Sense.getWeapon(player)
    return "Unknown";
end

function Sense.getHealth(player)
    local character = player and EspInterface.getCharacter(player);
    local humanoid = character and findFirstChildOfClass(character, "Humanoid");
    if humanoid then
        return humanoid.Health, humanoid.MaxHealth;
    end
end

```
## Unloading Sense
```lua
Sense.Unload()
```

Sirius Sense was created by mickey for Sirius. It is being actively updated and developed by mickey.
